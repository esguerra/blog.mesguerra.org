The author of this blog is [Mauricio Esguerra](https://mesguerra.org), a computational biopolymer chemist, working at [AstraZeneca Gothenburg](https://www.astrazeneca.com/our-company/our-locations/gothenburg.html) in Sweden. This blog deals with RNA, DNA, Proteins (G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR's), Kinases, Enzymes), and not-any-longer new but still to-date computational techniques, such as *markdown*, *github*, *jekyll*, and *siteleaf* which are used to write this blog.
