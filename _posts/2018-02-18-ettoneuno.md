This blog will deal with **RNA**, **DNA**, and G-Protein Coupled Receptors (**GPCR's**) in all of the dimensions known to its author.   
By dimensions I mean that, since they are biopolymers, they have many dimensions of interest, for example, *pharmaceutical*, *basic science*, *origin of life*, *polymer physics*, and *pure chemistry*, to name a few that come to mind.

But this is at the same time the blog of a computational chemist deeply involved and interested in web-development, programming, building computers, high performance computing, bioinformatics, and statistics.
