This blog will deal with **RNA**, **DNA**, and G-Protein Coupled Receptors (**GPCR's**) in all of the dimensions known to its author.

By dimensions I mean that, since they are *biopolymers*, they have many dimensions of interest, for example, *pharmaceutical*, *basic science*, *origin of life*, *polymer physics*, and *pure chemistry*, to name a few that come to mind.

But this is at the same time the blog of a computational chemist deeply involved and interested in web-development, programming, building computers, high performance computing, bioinformatics, and statistics.

Specifically I was thinking about a once an for all final solution to easily write a blog. I wanted to be able to write in markdown and use github, but at the same time I wanted to have a Content Management System (CMS) GUI type of a thing, in case others who don't share my love for the *terminal* would be able to make posts with drag and drop pictures and such amenities. In the end it has boiled down to using in a combined way *siteleaf*, *jekyll*, and *github*.

I also wanted to be able to upload images "easily", and, this is a good functionality of GUI's, in my opinion.

For example the next image of an RNA double helix of special interest to us:
