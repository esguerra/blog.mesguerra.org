This blog will deal with **RNA**, **DNA**, and G-Protein Coupled Receptors (**GPCR's**) in all of the dimensions known to its author.

By dimensions I mean that, since they are biopolymers, they have many dimensions of interest, for example, *pharmaceutical*, *basic science*, *origin of life*, *polymer physics*, and *pure chemistry*, to name a few that come to mind.

But this is at the same time the blog of a computational chemist deeply involved and interested in web-development, programming, building computers, high performance computing, bioinformatics, and statistics.

The reason why this first post is called "the quest for the ultimate solution" is because that "provocative" title, can be interpreted in many ways, hopefully not the awfully negative historical one. Specifically I was thinking about the ultimate solution for writing a blog. I wanted to be able to write in markdown and use github, but at the same time I wanted to have a Content Management System (CMS) GUI type of a thing, in case others who don't share my love for the *terminal* would be able to make posts with drag and drop pictures and such amenities. In the end it has boiled down to using in a combined way *siteleaf*, *jekyll*, and *github*.

I also wanted to be able to upload images "easily", and, this is a good functionality of GUI's, in my opinion.

For example the next image of an RNA double helix of special interest to us:
