We are meeting once a week to do a fast review of the [GPCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor)
literature. I have selected to review the Journal of Molecular Biology
\(JMB), and Cell Journal.

These two journals publish two issues per month, but they also have a
just-accepted area where articles are published before an assigned
volume is published.

For this week there is no explicit mention of GPCR's in the **Online now** area
of **Cell**, or in the **Articles in Press** area of JMB.

So, that leaves us with just the latest volumes.

### [\[JMB Volume 430, Issue 4\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-molecular-biology/vol/430/issue/4)

Dedicated issue on single molecule approaches to "difficult
challenges" on folding and dynamics. No specific articles on **GPCR's**

There is one quite related review on membrane protein folding
studies:

**- [Applications of Single-Molecule Methods to Membrane Protein Folding Studies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2017.05.021)**\
Robert E.Jefferson Duyoung Min Karolina Corin Jing Yang Wang James U. Bowie\
The article can be related to all membrane proteins as it's written in
a completely general way, and there's specific mention of **GPCR's**
when talking about oligomerization and force-unfolding. They reference Mathiasen-Kobilka-Stamou et
al. 2014, Nature-Methods,  who worked with beta2-adrenergic, cannabinoid type I, and
opsin. It turns out that with some fitting of FRET signals of
reconstituted GPCR's in proteoliposomes, they estimate a dissociation
free-energy of around *4.66* kcal/mol for the beta2-adrenergic
receptor. The technique only works for measuring weak interactions, as
in the case of GPCR's oligomers.
Later bacteriorhodospsin and other GPCR's are also mentioned in the context of
force-unfolding measurements.

### [\[Cell Volume 172, Issue 4\]](http://www.cell.com/cell/issue?pii=S0092-8674(17)X0004-4)

**- [5-HT2C Receptor Structures Reveal the Structural Basis of GPCR Polypharmacology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.01.001)**\
Yao Peng, others, Gloriam, Roth, Stevens, Liu\
This article comes with a *Preview* article by Patrick M. Sexton and
Arthur Christopoulos contextualizing GPCR Polypharmacology, which they
describe as:

> "the interaction of a single drug with multiple targets"
